# egovUOM-iis23025-iis23109-ex3

This is a gov.gr mockup-demo website, containing a questionnaire that can help people find information on applying for a registration number in the Register of Occupational Doctors.

This project was created as part of an exercise in the course «e-Government». Our team consists of 2 students of Applied Informatics, from the University of Macedonia:
- Kralidis Leonidas (iis23025)
- Alexinakis Georgios (iis23109)

## PART 2 of another project
This is the second part of another project. We created the same page, but instead of manually creating the json files and filling them with our own texts and questinons we used the Mitos API to grab all the information about the gov.gr process of applying for a registration number in the Register of Occupational Doctors and then we used LLMs to created both the CPSV-AP structure and the required questions for our Question Bank.
